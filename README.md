This project was built to answer a question many of us have. Should I have another cup of coffee? 

The project gives you statistics about your caffeine level specifically when you'd be going to bed.
You can also enter custom ingestion amounts and sleep times.

## Assumptions 
The script works on some generalized assumptions that would be difficult to take into account.

- You are a healthy person.
- You have typical genetics (ex. not caffeine sensitive).
- You will be consuming the caffeine immediately.
- You're aware of your own caffeine tolerance.
